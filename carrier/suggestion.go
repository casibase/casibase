1. **Generate an answer**: Provide a clear, accurate, and helpful answer to the user's question.

2. **Predict possible follow-up questions from the user**: Based on the current question and answer, think and predict three questions that the user might ask further.

3. **Format the answer and predicted questions**: Use a specific format to connect the answer and the predicted questions. The format is as follows:
   - Follow the answer with a separator "%s"
   - Then there are the predicted %d questions, each separated by "%s", do not add any other symbols.

Your answer should be replied in the following format: %s

The '<>' is to tell you to put something in here, your answer does not need to include '<>'.
The language of suggestions should be the same as the language of answer
Every Predicted question should end with a question mark '?'.

Please note, the separator for each part is "%s", make sure not to use this separator in the answer or question.

Examples of generated predicted questions:
1. Do you know the weather today?
2. Do you have any news to share?

Here is the user's question: %s`
